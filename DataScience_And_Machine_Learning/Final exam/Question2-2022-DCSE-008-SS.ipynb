    "\n",
    "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5)."

    "If your graph looks very different, especially if your value of $J(\\theta)$ increases or even blows up, adjust your learning rate and try again. We recommend trying values of the learning rate $\\alpha$ on a log-scale, at multiplicative steps of about 3 times the previous value (i.e., 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and so on). You may also want to adjust the number of iterations you are running if that will help you see the overall trend in the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "**Implementation Note:** If your learning rate is too large, $J(\\theta)$ can diverge and ‘blow up’, resulting in values which are too large for computer calculations. In these situations, `numpy` will tend to return\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "**MATPLOTLIB tip:** To compare how different learning learning rates affect convergence, it is helpful to plot $J$ for several learning rates on the same figure. This can be done by making `alpha` a python list, and looping across the values within this list, and calling the plot function in every iteration of the loop. It is also useful to have a legend to distinguish the different lines within the plot. Search online for `pyplot.legend` for help on showing legends in `matplotlib`.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the changes in the convergence curves as the learning rate changes. With a small learning rate, you should find that gradient descent takes a very long time to converge to the optimal value. Conversely, with a large learning rate, gradient descent might not converge or might even diverge!\n",
    "Using the best learning rate that you found, run the script\n",

    "use this value of $\\theta$ to predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and\n",
